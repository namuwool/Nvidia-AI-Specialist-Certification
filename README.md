Screw Collection and Classification for Construction Site Safety



Opening background information 
---
<aside>
✅ Small screws left unattended at construction sites pose a threat to machinery and worker safety, yet they are not easy to locate instantly. Currently, magnetic screwdrivers are used to prevent screw loss, but this approach has its limitations. To address these issues, an AI-based system capable of detecting and classifying screws is needed.

General description of the current project
---
<aside>
✅ This project aims to develop an AI-based screw recognition system to easily collect screws dropped at construction sites. It detects screws that fall or roll on the ground in real-time, preventing them from entering construction machinery or being overlooked by workers. Through this, the project seeks to enhance safety and improve work efficiency at construction sites.

</aside>


Current limitations
---
<aside>
✅ There are many types of screws, so it takes a long time to train the system to recognize various kinds of screws. Additionally, the high density of objects at construction sites can cause occlusion depending on the environment, making it difficult to detect screws.

Video Acquisition Method
---
- Various scenarios involving screws were staged and recorded, and validation was conducted by capturing situations where screws are present, rolling, or falling.
